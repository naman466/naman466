I am a computer science student who believes that **deep understanding comes from building things yourself**.  
Instead of only using high level libraries, I explore the layers beneath, from IEEE 754 floating point to compiler IRs and kernel execution.

My goal is to contribute to research in **efficient deep learning** and **low level ML infrastructure**.  
Right now, I am in the learning phase, and every project is an excuse to pull back the curtain.

## 🔍 What I work on

**🧮 Numerical foundations**  
I implement numerical computing concepts from scratch to understand how numbers behave in hardware and why that matters for neural networks.  
→ [`numerical-methods`](https://github.com/naman466/numerical-methods) – IEEE 754 (FP32, bfloat16), rounding, overflow, NaNs, precision tradeoffs.

**⚙️ Compiler style lowering**  
I am exploring how a high level model graph (ONNX) can be lowered into executable C code, essentially a miniature ML compiler built for learning.  
→ [`null`](https://github.com/naman466/null) – graph traversal, IR design, operation lowering, code generation.

**📉 Model efficiency**  
Alongside systems work, I study sparsity, pruning, quantization, and optimisation with the aim of making models smaller and faster without sacrificing accuracy.  
More projects coming as I deepen this direction.

## 🧭 Research interests

- Model efficiency and compression  
- Low level optimisation for deep learning  
- Numerical behaviour of neural networks  
- ML systems and compiler style execution  

I actively read systems and efficiency papers and build small prototypes to test ideas in practice.  
Long term, I hope to contribute to the ML systems research community.
